# Machine-Learning-Find-S-Algorithm
Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from "enjoysport.csv" file and show the output for test cases. Develop an interactive program by Comparing the result by implementing LIST THEN ELIMINATE algorithm.
